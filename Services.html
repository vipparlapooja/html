        One of the unique things about nature is that it pulls us into experiencing sensory awareness, rather than being caught up in our thoughts.

When your senses are captivated by the beauty and mystery of a natural setting, it slows all the noise of mental chatter that normally clogs up our attention.

Consider that having this quiet mind grounded in the senses is a really huge shift in awareness from how most modern people spend their time.

Most people are extremely disconnected from their senses on a day-to-day basis.

We live in a world of almost constant bombardment of screens, information, technology, and long boring hours working inside surrounded by concrete walls.

Itâ€™s no wonder people feel overwhelmed, stressed, anxious and burnt out, moving through their days in a haze that makes it difficult to fully enjoy life.

For this reason, nature is a balancing force that helps us clear our mind of all the scattered junk and worries.

It gets you out of your head and into your body.
