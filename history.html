           <p> Nature is filled with so much beauty, life & wisdom that it’s only natural to feel uplifted in the presence of big trees & singing birds.

            But have you ever thought about why we feel this way?  I’ve learned from experience that being in touch with a genuine love for nature makes it easier to share that love and pass it on to others in our life (like children, friends & family).
            
            To cultivate appreciation for all aspects of nature is an essential step towards bringing our modern society into harmony with life on this earth.</p>
